  Abstract                 = {In this paper we extend our earlier results on output synchronization of nonlinear passive systems to the case of nonlinear systems with relative degree one. It is well known [5] that weakly minimum phase systems with relative degree one are feedback equivalent to a passive system with a positive definite storage function. We exploit this feedback equivalence to develop control laws for output synchronization of such systems, exchanging outputs on balanced graphs, and in the presence of communication delays, and switching interconnection topologies. We further show that the balanced graph assumption can be removed provided the internal dynamics in the normal form are Input-to-State-Stable (ISS) for each agent. Simulation results are presented to verify the obtained results.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we consider the output synchronization problem for heterogeneous networks of linear agents. The networkâ€™s communication infrastructure provides each agent with a linear combination of its own output relative to that of neighboring agents, and it allows the agents to exchange information about their own internal observer estimates. We design decentralized controllers based on setting the control input of a single root agent to zero and letting the remaining agents synchronize to the root agent. A distinguishing feature of our work is that the agents are assumed to be non-introspective, meaning that they possess no knowledge about their own state or output separate from what is received via the network. We also consider the problem of regulating the agreement trajectory according to an a priori specified reference model. In this case we assume that some of the agents have access to their own output relative to the reference trajectory.},

We propose a ldquo;greedy rdquo; policy to control a swarm of autonomous agents in the pursuit of one or several evaders. At each instant of time this policy directs the pursuers to the locations that maximize the probability of finding an evader at that particular time instant. It is shown that, under mild assumptions, this policy guarantees that an evader is found in finite time and that the expected time needed to find the evader is also finite. Simulations are included to illustrate the results},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we consider a distributed control design problem. Multiple agents (or subsystems) that are dynamically uncoupled need to be controlled to optimize a joint cost function. An interconnection graph specifies the topology according to which the agents can access information about each others’ state. We propose and partially analyze a new model for determining the influence of the topology of the interconnection graph on the performance achieved by the subsystems. We consider the classical linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) cost function and propose making one of the weight matrices to be topology dependent to capture the extra cost incurred when more communication between the agents is allowed. We present results about optimal topologies for some models of the dependence of the weight matrix on the communication graph. We also give some results about the existence of “critical prices” at which adding supplementary edges becomes detrimental to closed-loop performance. One conclusion of the work is that if the communication between the agents comes at a cost, then adding communication edges may be harmful for the system performance.},

  Abstract                 = {In this technical note, we consider the cooperative output regulation of linear multi-agent systems. The overall system consists of two groups of subsystems. While the first group of subsystems can access the exogenous signal, the second cannot. As a result, the problem cannot be solved by the decentralized approach. By devising a distributed observer, we can solve the problem by a dynamic full information distributed control scheme. The problem can also be viewed as a generalization of some results of the leader-following consensus problem of multi-agent systems.},
